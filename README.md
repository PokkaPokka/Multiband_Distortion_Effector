# Multiband_Distortion_Effector
A multiband distortion effector is a type of audio processor that involves applying distortion effects to specific frequency bands of a sound signal independently. 
The audio signal is divided into several frequency bands using a two filters of the user choice network. Each band is then processed individually. 
This approach provides more control and flexibility over the tonal characteristics of the distorted sound.

1. The effectors enables the user to specidy 3 frequency bands, using one of two cut-off steepness chosen by the user. 
2. There are tree types of distortion to choose from, overdrive, soft-clipping, and hard-clipping.
3. The user can adjust individually of the amount of distortion for left and right cahnnel.
4. Panning and dry-wet level control support.
5. Viewing the general and three ranges' spectrum.
